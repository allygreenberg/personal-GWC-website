    </h2>

    <p>
        Hey, I'm Ally Greenberg and I am a student at Spanish River High School who is interested in program development and innovative technology. I also enjoy running, shopping, and creative writting. Currently I am taking AP Computer Science A and I have previously completed AP Computer Science Principals. I am looking for a summer intership with a tech company in hopes of learning the ropes. I am well versed in Javascript and Pythan, and working on learning C++.
